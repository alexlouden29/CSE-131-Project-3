Despite being a bigger project in theory, so far Project 3 has felt more manageable.  This likely comes from the fact that most of the coding is using the more familiar architecture of c, rather than flex or bison or whatever we were using.

We started by writing out the header file and functions for our symboltable.  This first draft turned out to be fairly incorrect later on, but it helped us see where we might go next.  Next we attempted to write the check method for VarDecl, which actually came out well and has required few edits moving foreward.  Afterwards we focused on understanding how virtual was used to spread check() throughout the program, and also how we would go about saving the symbol table.  For the symbol table, we decided on a global variable declared in Node, but we have not done enough testing yet to know if it is correct.

Next up was expr checks, which involved realizing that we needed to make a different virtual function CheckWithType() that returned the type of the expression so that other checks could access type information.  This has been going along well.  Currently we are working on statement checks, starting with Program which was tested and functional.  I will return with the rest of the project description.
